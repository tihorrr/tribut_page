          <h1>Biography</h1>
          <p class="lead"><b>Narendra Damodardas Modi</b>; (born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician who has served as the 14th Prime
             Minister of India since May 2014. Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP)
            for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu 
            nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress.

            In 1995 Modi was made the secretary of the BJP	&apos;s national organization in New Delhi, and three years later he was appointed its 
            general secretary. He remained in that office for another three years, but in October 2001 he replaced the incumbent Gujarat chief
             minister, fellow BJP member Keshubhai Patel, after Patel had been held responsible for the state government	&apos;s poor response in the 
             aftermath of the massive Bhuj earthquake in Gujarat earlier that year that killed more than 20,000 people. Modi entered his first-ever
              electoral contest in a February 2002 by-election that won him a seat in the Gujarat state assembly.

            As prime minister, Modi oversaw a promotion of Hindu culture and the implementation of economic reforms. The government undertook measures 
            that would broadly appeal to Hindus, such as its attempt to ban the sale of cows for slaughter. The economic reforms were sweeping, introducing
             structural changes—and temporary disruptions—that could be felt nationwide. Among the most far-reaching was the demonetization and replacement
              of 500- and 1,000-rupee banknotes with only a few hours notice. The purpose was to stop “black money”—cash used for illicit activities—by
               making it difficult to exchange large sums of cash. The following year the government centralized the consumption tax system by introducing
                the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which superseded a confusing system of local consumption taxes and eliminated the problem of cascading tax.
                 GDP growth slowed from these changes, though growth had already been high (8.2 percent in 2015), and the reforms succeeded in expanding the
                  government&apos;s tax base. Still, rising costs of living and increasing unemployment disappointed many as grandiose promises of economic growth
                   remained unfulfilled.
